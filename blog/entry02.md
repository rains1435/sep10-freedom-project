# Entry 2: My Findings (Financing)
##### 11/4/24

## I entered the cave and saw...

I went into the cave full of answers called [Google](https://www.google.com/) which I needed for financial researching purposes. [Nerdwallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/), a personal finance software for newcomers/ beginners and it has articles that offer financial advice (as covered in the Blog Entry 1 sources). After that discovery, I was motivated so I walked deeper into the cave searching for *__"good personal financing softwares."__* Then I came across [GoodBudget](https://goodbudget.com/). Like Nerdwallet, it is beginner friendly, comprehensible budgeting tool called the Envelope **(categorizes user's money spending in many fields like Family, personal, or grocery spendings)**, and its versatile nature of it being able to display the same information on different devices. Two softwares discovered so far! Now onto the another route in the cave known as the **Hardware Swamp...** notorious for its difficulty for finding hardwares related to personal financing. I searched for *__"hardwares for financing"__* to no avail until Mr. Mueller, our teacher, came along and suggested that a tool called AI may help but **don't overuse it**. The next day, I came back with an AI tool which detected some hardwares hiding deep in the swamps. Throughout the day, I found 2 hardwares that is perfect for my cause which is to help teenagers **(financially ignorant)**: **[The Ekster Smart Wallet](https://www.ekster.com/blogs/the-journal/what-s-a-smart-wallet)**, a revolutionary product that changes the style of wallets and it's philosophical value of minimalism. The wallet itself is 5x stronger than steel **(Caborn Fiber)**, less likely for personal information to be breached **(blocks RFI)**, and **due to its small design, it influences people to decide how much money to put in their wallets. The idea is to minimalize money being spent on irrelevant items, a good start to budgeting.** However, the second hardware is more straightfoward: **[The RingPay Smart Ring](https://mclear.com/ringpay/features/).** Simplicity and convenience is considered in the making of the ring -- pay with a single tap, lost ring can be found with your smart device, **password before making a big purchase**, and can own up to four rings (can share funds between the four rings). At the end of the day, I exited the Google cave, proud with my findings. For the time being, I collected extra data by asking teenagers around my neighborhood about their financial knowledge, **"Do you have a budget?"** or **"How good are you at saving money?"** 70-80% are clueless on how to budget and 20-30% are good at saving money/ budgeting. Now I'm ready. . .

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)

I am in the second step of EDP which is **Research the Problem**. Currently I've found two helpful beginner friendly softwares and two hardwares that fit the category also **(softwares and hardwares explained in the paragraph above).** Moreover with the data I've collected from the survey, 70-80% of teenagers are financially ignorant and 20-30% are budgeting amateurs. Based on this, for step three of EDP, **brainstorm possible solutions**, I will come up with a hardware device similar to RingPay or a software similar to NerdWallet or a combination of both NerdWallet and RingPay. **The end goal = beginner friendly personal financing innovation.**

## Skills

**Experience = new skills developed.** The skills I've developed are how to read, Organization, and Time management.

#### How to read

**Before I start, I know how to read since elementary school** but in this scenario, I'm talking about the skills I developed on how to read easier/ efficiently. While reading those softwares and hardwares articles, **I learned to skim to find the main points, skipping fillers.** I would come back and re-read to check if I had missed anything important. Satisfying feeling of understanding an article and being able to derive it, best skill to have in my opinion.

#### Organization

This skill is connected to the **"How to read"** skill as after I've derive the main points of the articles, I organize them into their respective category. Well it is mandatory because Mr. Mueller told us to use bullet points when taking notes on the articles. I guess I can admit Mr. Mueller helped me become more organized with the avaliability of **"SEP NOTES"** and his **homeworks (wants us to be organized)**. However, I prefer this change very much because it will do big time for me, especially of how messy I am.

#### Time management

Since I've developed the skill of organization, I also have to organize my time. I try not to cram gaming/ leisure time into school days and it has been improving ever since. When there is a ton of homework, I will manage my time by finding the best times to stop and take breaks **(I got ADHD so I stress excessively)**. Managing my time is really helpful and there isn't much to be said about it.

## Next Step

Brainstorm innovations or solutions to educating teenagers on financing, preferably budgeting. Maybe a software, a hardware or both all in one.
