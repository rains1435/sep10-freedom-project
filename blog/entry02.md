## I entered the cave and saw...

I gathered up the courage to enter the unknown cave... It was confusing at first since I didn't know the way but as I discovered more about the cave, I became familiar. The unknown cave is called [Google](https://www.google.com/), a cave filled with answers I needed for this financial researching purposes. [Nerdwallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/), a personal finance software for newcomers/ beginners and it has articles that offer financial advice (as covered in the Blog Entry 1 sources). After that discovery, I was motivated so I walked deeper into the cave searching for good personal financing softwares. Then I came across Goodbudget, a wise old **(I wouldn't say old, more like middle aged)** man recommended me this software and his name is Mr. Mueller. He explained that, like Nerdwallet, it is beginner friendly, comprehensible budgeting tool called the Envelope **(categorizes user's money spending in many fields like Family, personal, or grocery spendings)**, and its versatile nature of it being able to display the same information on different devices.
