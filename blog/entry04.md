# Entry 4: Choosing my Tool
##### 02/24/25

## The ULTIMATE Tool I chose and why...

I had many choices about what tools to choose based on the tools Mr. Mueller gave us. I was hesitant and a little bit confused about my path/ what to choose at first because everything seemed so mysterious and new to me. For that, I had to tinker around with the tools to find my top 3 **AND THEN** narrow it down to my final choice. I found 3 tools I was interested in based on their description: jQuery, Aframe, and CSS grid.

First, I tinkered with jQuery first which was a tough yet fun experience and a little foreshadowing is that I didn't choose this as my final tool. For example, I learned how to hide text by clicking a button or alerting the user if they clicked a certain element on the webpage.
``` js
        <script>
            //click h2 text to reveal message/ alert user

            $(document).ready(function(){
                $("h2").mousedown(function(){
                    alert("YOU'VE ENTERED THE SCARY DUNGEON");
                });

            //click button to hide p tag

                $("button").click(function(){
                    $(".hide").hide();
                });
            });
        </script>
```
