# Entry 1: Final Decision (Personal Financing)
##### 10/7/24

## What I had in mind...

Transportation was the first decision I had in mind because it was something that I thought would be easy to do a project on. However, I wasn't passionate about choosing transportation as my final subject idea, so I went onto the career list Mr. Mueller gave us (thank you for giving us that list, Mr. Mueller), and the first thing on the list was accounting. That's when my newfound passion for financing began. Well, not really, since I already had a passion for financing for almost a year, and it stemmed from me googling lots of "Tips and Tricks to Become a Better Spender." Also here are the findings that caught my eye on what I've researched: Article #1: [How to Budget Money in 5 Steps](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/how-to-budget) This was the first article I found a year ago when I was googling "How to budget my money?" and it's not so helpful, considering this article is predominately adult-related budgeting. Long-term, this information will contribute to many smart choices I make in the future. Article #2: [Speaking With Your Kids About Finance](https://www.rocketmoney.com/learn/personal-finance/money-talks-speaking-with-your-kids-about-finances) one of the articles that played the biggest role in making me a thousand percent more interested in financing (basically a version that my 14-year-old self can comprehend easier). To add on, I expanded my financial vocabulary after reading article #2 because I had to search the meaning of many words I didn't know (I had to look up what financing was). Article #3: [Top 10 articles of 2023](https://www.empower.com/the-currency/play/top-10-articles-2023). Another article I found while trying to expand my knowledge in finance, and with all honesty, EMPOWER personal capital is extremely helpful with personal financing (highly recommend it). Yeah, everything here explains how I got into financing and my (potentially) never-ending passion for financing.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)

Step 1 of the Engineering Design Process is to define the problem. I hope to solve the problem of financial ignorance among teenagers who are most likely going to need financial knowledge in the future. Step 2 of the EDP is to research the problem, and that requires some heavy googling but also some going around and asking others how well they manage their money (focus: teenagers—also to collect data to better understand and what to do next).

## Skills 

Some important skills while creating this blog are creativity, consideration, and growth mindset!

#### Creativity

"How is this and that creative???" Think about it: when someone says "financing,"  it's usually perceived as an adult topic. But the problem I am trying to solve sounds counterintuitive, and why would a teenager need to know about financing? That's the point: THEY NEED TO KNOW because the next stage of their life is adulthood and, to be brutally honest, pain. To add salt to the wound, financial ignorance is going to make their life difficult. So I decided to be creative and go against what the culture has to say.

#### Consideration

Consideration is like the similar counterpart of creativity in this scenario. The thing is that I am a teenager, and I want to help other teenagers with the same past struggles as me in budgeting to have some knowledge in financing. Without my consideration of the struggles faced by other teenagers, my creativity wouldn't have led me to the conclusion of helping them with money, and vice versa. I would say that consideration played a huge role in creating this blog and is an important skill I've developed

#### Growth Mindset

Lastly, and probably the area in which I've improved the most, is my GROWTH MINDSET. How did this happen? It all started with my research into the problem of financial issues in the world. During this process of Googling and thinking, my passion and perseverance grew as I read crucial information. Suddenly, creativity and consideration emerged in my mind, which was unexpected yet a blessing. With this new perspective, I began to consider the issue of teenagers' financial ignorance. To backtrack a bit, I realized that with the information I had gathered about financial problems, I developed both an open mind and a concerned mindset, particularly for those struggling financially. I thought, "Maybe those people weren't educated on financing early on... Wait, maybe to prepare the next generation of adults, they should be educated on money management." That's when everything started to come together. Hence, a growth mindset is the contributing factor to creativity and consideration."

## Next Step

I am going to use the data I collected from teenagers and come up with multiple possible solutions (data analysis).
