# Entry 1: Final Decision (Financing)
##### 10/7/24

## What I had in mind...

Transportation was the first decision I had in mind because it was something that I thought would be easy to do a project on. However, I wasn't passionate about choosing transportation as my final subject idea, so I went onto the career list Mr. Mueller gave us (thank you for giving us that list, Mr. Mueller), and the first thing on the list was accounting. That's when my newfound passion for financing began. Well, not really, since I already had a passion for financing for almost a year, and it stemmed from me googling lots of "Tips and Tricks to Become a Better spender." Also here are the findings that caught my eye on what I've researched: Article #1: [How to Budget Money in 5 Steps](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/how-to-budget) This was the first article I found a year ago when I was googling "How to budget my money?" and it's not so helpful, considering this article is predominately adult-related budgeting. Long-term, this information will contribute to many smart choices I make in the future. Article #2: [Speaking With Your Kids About Finance](https://www.rocketmoney.com/learn/personal-finance/money-talks-speaking-with-your-kids-about-finances) one of the articles that played the biggest role in making me a thousand percent more interested in financing  (Basically a version that my 14-year-old self can comprehend easier). Too add on, I expanded my financial vocabulary after reading article #2 because I had to search the meaning of many words I didn't know (I had to search up what financing was). Article #3: [Top 10 articles of 2023](https://www.empower.com/the-currency/play/top-10-articles-2023). Another article I found while trying to expand my knowledge in finance and with all honesty, EMPOWER personal capital is extremely helpful with personal financing (highly recommend it). Yeah, everything here explains how I got into financing and my (potentially) never ending passion for financing.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)

Step of 1 of the Engineering Design Process is to define the problem. I hope to solve the problem of financial ignorance of teenagers that are most likely going to need financial knowledge in the future. Step 2 of the EDP is to research the problem and that requires some heavy googling but also some going around and asking others how well they manage their money (Focus: teenagers---Also to collect data to better understand and what to do next).

## Skills 

Some important skills while creating this blog are creativity, consideration, and growth mindset!

#### Creativity

"How is this and that creative???" Think about it, when someone says "financing", it's usually perceived as an adult topic. But the problem I am trying to solve sounds counter-intuitive and why would a teenager need to know about financing? That's the point, THEY NEED TO KNOW because the next stage of their life is adulthood and to be brutally honest, pain. To add salt to wound, financial ignorance is going to make their life diffcult. So I decided to be creative and go against what the culture has to say. 

#### Consideration

Consideration is like the similar counterpart of creativity in this scenario. The thing is that I am a teenager and I want to help other teenagers with the same past struggles as me in budgetting, to have some knowledge in financing. Without my consideration of the struggles of other teenagers, my creativity would've not come to the conclusion of helping teenagers with money, vice versa. I would say consideration played a huge role in creating this blog and an important skill I've developed.

#### Growth Mindset

Lastly, and probably the most I've improved on, GROWTH MINDSET. Yes and how? Well It all started with me researching the problem of financial problems in the world. During the process of googling and thinking, my passion and peservance grew through reading crucial informations. All of a sudden, Creativity and Consideration appeared in my mind which was unexpected yet a blessing. With this, I thought of the problem of Teenager's financial ignorance. Lets backtrack, a little and so what happened was that with information I had about financial problems, I developed an open mind and a worried mind, specifically for people who are struggling financially. I thought, "Maybe those people weren't educated on financing early on... Wait, maybe to prepare the next generation of adults, they should be educated on money management." That's when everything started to come together. Hence, Growth mindset is the contributing factor for creativity and consideration.

## Next Step

I am going to use the data I collected from teenagers and come up with multiple possible solutions (data analysis).
