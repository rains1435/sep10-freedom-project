# Entry 3: Brainstorming the Perfect Innovation (Personal Financing)
##### 12/18/24

## What I've thought of...

So for the past couple weeks, I've been thinking about inoovating something... something that can change the world, that can benefit teenagers my age. First I thought of creating something similar to **[RingPay](https://mclear.com/ringpay/features/)** and **[Ekster Smart Wallet](https://www.ekster.com/blogs/the-journal/what-s-a-smart-wallet)** or a combination of both. However, the problem is that it's already an existing concept and it would basically be a copy and paste. Secondly, I came up with an **5 foot AI robot assistant** for helping one stay on a strict spending "diet" or budget similar to **[Misa AI bot](https://www.heymisa.com/)** but without the financing mindset. It was good and my online friends did approve of it, but it's requires space and isn't easily portable. What if someone goes outside and makes big purchases, how will the robot follow and keep up without it being embarrassing? That's the problem and during that time, I hit a dead end, I was confused and I kept thinking but I stopped. One day, while I was talking to my friends about money, I thought about the Smart devices and how they are small and portable. Then I thought of the 5 foot AI robot assistant that does financing. I said to myself *"What if there was a AI robot assistant that is the size of a **[RingPay](https://mclear.com/ringpay/features/)**?"* 

### My Innovation

I came up with **DroidNosMoney**, a revolutionary technology that comes in hardware form and software form, interconnected into one innovation and is mandatory for everyone to have. **DroidNosMoney** is a small cube that communicates and constructively criticizes you on how you spend your money. It's linked to your guardians account until one is 18+, so if one decides to not follow a set of rules and miss out on task without a reasonable explanation, the AI will inform the Guardian about it. As a result, you can get locked out of your account and so you cannot spend money until you give a good reason why you won't do it again to your parents and they have the power to unlock it. 

### Feedback from Peers

I posted this idea onto the "2027" slack channel and one feedback I received was from Darren, asking me how will I get this innovation approved by the government and how much would one cost if required by the government?

### Adding more...
After the feedback from Darren, I thought about possible ways for enforcing this onto most of the world. In my mind, it wouldn't be 100% but one day, the world might go into a financial crisis within society so I'll make an advertisement promoting my innovation to the general public and it might reach the government if it goes mainstream. The end goal is to teach future generations or teenagers about financing so it will fill in the gap and perhaps, end the crisis. The cost on the other hand will rise as inflation increases so there's no definite price but if it was introduced in 2024, it would be a reasonable price of no more or less than 15$.

### So now I'm ready... 
To organize my contents into my webiste, I'll first introduce what personal financing is and the existing technolgies + the futuristic technologies or more commonly known as smart devices. Then I'll categorize the hardwares and softwares I've found throughout the months, into 3 categories. First category is "The Beginning: Basic Softwares"
