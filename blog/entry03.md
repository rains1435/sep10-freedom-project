# Entry 3: Brainstorming the Perfect Innovation (Personal Financing)
##### 12/18/24

## What I've thought of...

So for the past couple weeks, I've been thinking about inoovating something... something that can change the world, that can benefit teenagers my age. First I thought of creating something similar to **[RingPay](https://mclear.com/ringpay/features/)** and **[Ekster Smart Wallet](https://www.ekster.com/blogs/the-journal/what-s-a-smart-wallet)** or a combination of both. However, the problem is that it's already an existing concept and it would basically be a copy and paste. Secondly, I came up with an **5 foot AI robot assistant** for helping one stay on a strict spending "diet" or a budget, similar to **[Misa AI bot](https://www.heymisa.com/)** but without the financial mindset. It was good and my online friends did approve of it, but it's requires space and isn't easily portable. What if someone goes outside and makes big purchases, how will the robot follow and keep up without the user not being embarrassed? That's the problem and during that time, I hit a dead end, I was confused and I kept thinking but I stopped. One day, while I was talking to my friends about money, I thought about the Smart devices and how they are small and portable. Then I thought of the 5 foot AI robot assistant that does financing. I said to myself *"What if there was a AI robot assistant that is the size of a **[RingPay](https://mclear.com/ringpay/features/)**?..."* 

### My Innovation

I came up with **DroidNosMoney**, a revolutionary technology that comes in hardware form and software form, interconnected into one innovation and is mandatory for everyone to have. **DroidNosMoney** is a small cube that communicates and constructively criticizes you on how you spend your money. It's linked to your guardians account until one is 18+, so if one decides to not follow a set of rules and miss out on task without a reasonable explanation, the AI will inform the Guardian about it. As a result, you can get locked out of your account and so you cannot spend money until you give a good reason why you won't do it again to your parents and they have the power to unlock it. With its strict persona, teenagers who are troubled by their own lapse of judgement, will feel the true absence of not spending money. *No chips, drinks, new released games, shirts, pants, or the trendiest shoes will be in their possession without the bot in locked mode.* However if one has a good karma rank, they'll be rewarded with company paid trips, free merchandise, and a lot more!

**FINAL NOTE: Kids with disabilities are given a lenient AI bot so there's no bias.**  

### Feedback from Peers

I posted this idea onto the "2027" slack channel and one feedback I received was from Darren, asking me how will I get this innovation approved by the government and how much would one cost if required by the government?

### Adding more...
After the feedback from Darren, I thought about possible ways for enforcing this onto most of the world. In my mind, it wouldn't be 100% but one day, the world might go into a financial crisis within society so I'll make an advertisement promoting my innovation to the general public and it might reach the government if it goes mainstream. The end goal is to teach future generations or teenagers about financing so it will fill in the gap and perhaps, end the crisis. The cost on the other hand will rise as inflation increases so there's no definite price but if it was introduced in 2024, it would be a reasonable price of no more or less than 15$.

### So now I'm ready... 
To organize my contents into my webiste, I'll first introduce what personal financing is and the existing technolgies + the futuristic technologies or more commonly known as smart devices. Then I'll categorize the hardwares and softwares I've found throughout the months, into 3 separate categories. First category is **The Beginning: Basic Softwares -> [Nerdwallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/) and [GoodBudget](https://goodbudget.com/).** The second category is **The Modernized: Smart Hardwares -> [The Ekster Smart Wallet](https://www.ekster.com/blogs/the-journal/what-s-a-smart-wallet) and [The RingPay Smart Ring](https://mclear.com/ringpay/features/).** The third category is **The Jack Of All Trades: Known for Versatility -> [Personal Capital](https://www.empower.com/empower-personal-wealth-transition) and [Document Scanner](https://www.scansnapit.com/uk/scansnap-software/scansnap-home).** Lastly, I will introduce the futuristic innovation, **DroidNosMoney**, with its details, functionality, and benefit on future generations to come **(teaching about finance).**

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)

I am in the third step of EDP: **Brainstorm possible solutions**. As previously mentioned, I've thought of a big project, a mandatory and portable strict AI bot for teenagers who are ignorant of how to manage their money. Project DroidNosMoney is still in its pre-beta so there will be many disagreements and much more refinements before beta or release. The next step of EDP is to **plan the most promosing solution** and for me, I am thinking of *making it equally accessible to adults who are ignorant of financing.*

## Skills
Oh man... It's been a long time since I've written a blog entry, it felt difficult for some reason but eventually I figured it out. The skills I improved in are growth mindset, embracing failure, and most definitely organization.

#### Growth mindset
After I wrote two writeups **(AVD writeup weeks ago and CLI writeup last week)** before writing this blog entry #3, I felt burnt out and almost fell into procrasination. However, today **(12/18/24)**, I asked Mr. Mueller for help in tutoring and I learned a lot, especially embracing failure **(will be talked about next).** Before asking Mr. Mueller, I felt discouraged and didn't really want to write the blog entry #3 and it's because I got a 9/10 on my CLI writeup **(will dive deeper in next section)** and a 8/10 for my content doc H.W. assignment. However, asking for help and now, patiently writing this, feels like I have relit my burning passion for compeleting assignments and also to continue to push **(Never give up; Christmas break motivated me).**

### Embracing Failure
You must curious on what I mean by **embracing failure** from the previous section right? Alright let me tell you what changed me and how it happened. In tutoring **(12/18/24)**, I was confused on how to begin my Blog Entry #3 due to burnout and lack of motivation to do any type of work. So I asked Mr. Mueller multiple questions at different time intervals, even if I didn't want to. The thing that changed after tutoring was that although I got a 9/10 and 8/10 **- (I was upset because I usually get a 10/10 on assignments in which it ingrained that expectation in my head) -** on previous assignments, the important part is to learn from it. I rushed the CLI and Content Doc H.W without reading the slides thus it was my fault. Onto why I changed suddenly: **Mr. Mueller's help and feedback about the why I got those grades on thos assignments brought me back to reality and taught me to accept it and make the best of it next time.** Now it's time to learn and do better next time, no excuses for not reading the slides because **"if I am given a opportunity, I won't waste it".**

#### Organization
Organization is pretty self-explanatory, considering that we just learned about command line interface which requires the knowledge of categorizing and organizing files in directories. Additionally, I've been organizing my work and notes recently for other classes like in SEP10, I've been adding dates to the work I do **(I use to not include dates)** and it made finding notes much easier. Another method was bolding key/ important words and italicizing semi important words/ phrases. Combine sizing and bolding, it creates a **"social hierarchy"** *to categorize words with bigger and bolder text as the main topic and smaller and light text as paragraphs of text.* Overall, it creates a organized environment for notes and makes everything much easier to identify **(Mr. Mueller, much appreciated the CLI lessons).**

## Next Step

The goal for next step is to do the final/ important tweaks to my current innovation, DriodNosMoney, specifically focused on making it accesible to anyone who finds financing annoying **(To educate them via experience).** I want everyone to feel knowledgable, smart, and stress free if they are planning their spending every week for that is my #1 goal.
