# Entry 7: Showing my FINAL Product (Personal Finance)

## [In-Class Slideshow Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1l8HibQ5TgIsmAdhigLwPuNuMtffFIAh7fjHVrmLp46c/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p)

*Okay before I get to typing, I want to say how long I've come because this is the **LAST BLOG ENTRY** I will be doing. Thanks for reading all my blogs and I hope you enjoy this one!*

So I was finally done with making final touches on my **[webpage](https://rains1435.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/)** and after that we had to create a slideshow to present to my period 8 class. The gist of the slides were to present my webpage, the theme, and challenges we'd have faced **(There are more of course)**.

During presentation day #1 **(Monday, 5/19/25)**, I was second to present **(I expected that because I chose to be one of the first to present on the form).** To be honest, the presentation felt like a breeze and I did better than what I've expected. First noticable change is that I'm not wearing a hood **(I didn't want to be all mysterious and stuff; it's weird).** Second noticable change is that, I didn't stutter as much as I did last presentation, which was like a few months ago **(I think I was a living minigun or something, but instead of harming, it was harming myself with embarrassment).** Lastly, I was looking at the whole class instead of just staring at Mr. Mueller like a creep **(This one, I felt good about).**

HOWEVER, nothing's perfect in this world and so I do have some takeaways.

### Takeaway #1
**STOP WITH THE FILLER RAIN!!!** Yes, I do indeed be adding a LOT of filler/ unnecessary words in my sentences while presenting **(and I still am in all of my blogs, even right now).** So when Mr. Mueller did the *"wrap it up"* hand signal in the back, I realized that I was just rambling a whole lot of whatever.

### Takeaway #2
**I sound so unserious while presenting/ informal.** This might be subjective to Mr. Mueller or other students but I think I was GENUINELY acting with the utmost unseriousness **(exaggeration. Rain is lying. He was semi unserious).** My story was too fictional, the way I spoke is weird, and my presence is unserious. But on a real note, I need act more formal next time I present or else it will become a habit and I will become #1 in New York state or even the whole world to be unintentionally unemployed **(I think so).**

## [Expo Elevator Pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eK1X_r4ohTGkchnmuBtZq8u5JjYSW5EbXBl_uLzJPHY/edit?tab=t.0#bookmark=id.q2cj7ikxe795)

For the Expo, I felt like I did much better than the In-class presentation. It was fast-paced and there wasn't a big script and rehearsal I had to remember. Firstly, I liked how I was quick and concise with my words; I did stutter, though it wasn't like it made me less coherent. Secondly, I LOVED how I was confident for some reason, and I'm saying confidence over the roof **(not because of some ego).** This greatly boosted my "quick and concise" factor as I wasn't scared of messsing up since the script wasn't really so so long. Lastly, I added a **"passionate/ relatability"** factor to my 1 minute presentation. Basically what that meant is that I sounded passionate and also I provided a backstory/ purpose for this presentation which I bet the judges could kind of relate to **(Making it relatable can definitely boost attention and other factors of the audience).**

### Takeaway #1
I'm going to be fine-tuning instead of big takeaways because I did pretty well with the Expo. **IT FELT KIND OF RUSHED.** Yes, one minute requires someone like me to rush the Expo and rushing definitely led to some stumbling of words **(stuttering).** So even if pressure was high, I should slow down and it might help with me not stumbling over words. This was lead to the #2 Takeaway.

### Takeaway #2
So stuttering is a huge issue but also the organization during the 1 minute Expo. I had a plan of what I wanted to say first, second, third, and lastly. However, I fell victim the the pressure -> I rushed -> organization ruined. I still don't understand how I managed to stay confident throughout that and definitely don't understand how the judges didn't catch that I was internally malfunctioning a bit **(It was kind of obvious physically)**

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)

**I AM DONE!!!** You heard it from me, I am seriously finished with EVERYTHING. I've done my finished my website (using A-Frame, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap), I've done my In-class presentation and Expo, and I've done PRACTICALLY EVERY STEP IN THE EDP PROCESS and I'M PROUD OF MYSELF. On a real note, I still have to communicate the result (Last EDP Step) to more people rather than the judges and my classmates. Nevertheless, I am basically done **(Thanks to Mr. Mueller's guidance throughout the year).**

## Skills
The last skill overview by Rain because there's going to be no more blogs after this **(school years coming to an end sadly)**

### Organization
For the In-class presentation and the Expo elevator pitch, I had to keep myself organized in terms of what I had to say and at what times I had to say this and that. A lot of memorizing but organizing helped as I was able to execute my presentation with an organized script. Though I did mess up a little on the organization for the elevator pitch as I only had one minute. It was just a little mistake so I'm not overly disappointed in myself (I am proud because organization was much better now than before). To be honest, SEP taught by Mr. Mueller really helped me progress in a lot of the skills I use to lack in (e.g., Organization, Time management, etc).

### Embracing Failure
Embracing that I've failed is something I've gotten better with. When Mr. Mueller sent out the grades for the in-class presentation **(I got a 7/10 which was lower than my expectation)**, I didn't complain about the grade I got, I saw it as an opportunity to improve. Additionally, I have a showcase in the school's auditorium about my Freedom Project **(basically presenting my slides to a big crowd of SEP students)**. So the constructive feedback from Mr. Mueller was an useful gift to make my presentation on Friday, June 6th in the auditorium, the best presentation ever! **(Hopefully).**

### Note for Mr. Mueller
Before I end the journey, I want to say something to you Mr. Mueller.

You've helped me so much throughout the year. At first (September), I thought the class would be boring and difficult. Clearly, I was wrong because if I compare present-self to September-self, I've changed so much. I learned how to manage my time, create a plan for workloads, and most importantly, I've learned how to create a webpage! I might be glorifying SEP10 too much but if you were in my position, you'll see how thankful I am for you Mr. Mueller. Seriously, I'm proud that I was fortunate enough to be accepted into SEP10 and to be taught by you. Never give up on teaching and keep spreading your change onto the upcoming generation of teenagers of HSTAT. You made a change on me, so wouldn't it make sense if you can do it again? I believe in you Mr. Mueller and have a nice day!

Sincerely,

Rain S.

## Next Step (Is there one?)

Well as you all know, my journey has ended and I've learned so much. But the question you might be asking, *Is there going to be a next step???*
I guess we'll never know... I'm joking. Of course there will be a next step but that's in the near future and I'm confident because AI is slowly becoming a superpower. I hope that my hardware, DroidNosMoney becomes a reality as it will make a huge impact on future teenagers who struggle with personal financing.

**Thanks for reading all my blogs! I hope you become the best version of yourself and have the greatest day ever!**
