## [In-Class Slideshow Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1l8HibQ5TgIsmAdhigLwPuNuMtffFIAh7fjHVrmLp46c/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p)

*Okay before I get to typing, I want to say how long I've come because this is the **LAST BLOG ENTRY** I will be doing. Thanks for reading all my blogs and I hope you enjoy this one!*

So I was finally done with making final touches on my **[webpage](https://rains1435.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/)** and after that we had to create a slideshow to present to my period 8 class. The gist of the slides were to present my webpage, the theme, and challenges we'd have faced **(There are more of course)**.

During presentation day #1 **(Monday, 5/19/25)**, I was second to present **(I expected that because I chose to be one of the first to present on the form).** To be honest, the presentation felt like a breeze and I did better than what I've expected. First noticable change is that I'm not wearing a hood **(I didn't want to be all mysterious and stuff; it's weird).** Second noticable change is that, I didn't stutter as much as I did last presentation, which was like a few months ago **(I think I was a living minigun or something, but instead of harming, it was harming myself with embarrassment).** Lastly, I was looking at the whole class instead of just staring at Mr. Mueller like a creep **(This one, I felt good about).**

HOWEVER, nothing's perfect in this world and so I do have some takeaways.
### Takeaway #1
**STOP WITH THE FILLER RAIN!!!** Yes, I do indeed be adding a LOT of filler/ unnecessary words in my sentences while presenting **(and I still am in all of my blogs, even right now).** So when Mr. Mueller did the *"wrap it up"* hand signal in the back, I realized that I was just rambling a whole lot of whatever.

### Takeaway #2
**I sound so unserious while presenting/ informal.** This might be subjective to Mr. Mueller or other students but I think I was GENUINELY acting with the utmost unseriousness **(exaggeration. Rain is lying. He was semi unserious).** My story was too fictional, the way I spoke is weird, and my presence is unserious. But on a real note, I need act more formal next time I present or else it will become a habit and I will become #1 in New York state or even the whole world to be unintentionally unemployed **(I think so).**
