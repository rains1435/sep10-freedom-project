# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* Context that led to me surveying; maybe tell a story from a third person point of view of me or first person POV **(Can be a pseudo-story)** and keep it short/ straight to the point; say this **after** the statistic.
* Show statistic of my survery about personal finance of teenagers **(MAKE IT MEANINGFUL).**
* Hint at something towards the end **(The hardware, DroidNosMoney)**

## Product
* Show important parts of the FINAL project **(post-beyond mvp, not mvp).**
  * The Navbar.
  * Information section **(From Part A or B).**
  * Show A-Frame.

## Process
* **IMPORTANT:** Throughout the presentation, add little parts of your story, not related to the code but the overall theme: **Personal Finance.**
* For the first part of me telling a story for context, create a slide **(WITH ANIMATION POPOUT EACH CLICK)** showing a simple cartoonish version of me and the story.
* For showing the important parts **(Each is one slide)**
  * The Navbar = **Give context of what a navbar is** + **Explain its importance** + **Show full code and explain some of the code; important ones.**
  * Information section (Show part of a section; 2 image) = **Describe what these sections are showing; Talk about its format and its contents** + **Show code FOR THOSE 2 SECTION and explain it via contrast; one has no `order` class, one has; Don't only explain `order` class, expand instead.**
  * For A-Frame (Show image of the A-Frame Scene) = **Brief explanation of this hardware; Summary, Purpose/ tie it back to personal finance** + **Briefly describe what you used to build this (e.g., Built by A-Frame, used only 2 shapes: box and circle etc)** (This will be shown during the end of the presentation).


## Conclusion
* "So what's the point of showing you this? Anybody?" **Ask the crowd** "It's because I want to show you the amazing things that can be done with code like creating an webpage about Personal Finance for teenagers via HTML, CSS, and other components." **---** "I know y'all are probably dying to see my webpage and want the link to my webpage, hopefully, but one last thing is: While the whole theme of this webpage is personal finance for teenagers like you, we have to also consider everybody else who is struggling in managing their money, because at the end of the day, we are them, just as much as we are they. Never forget that." **---** "That's all, for now. Thank you and I hope y'all learned something from this." **(Its own slide; shows text: "So what's the point of showing you this?")**
* URL +/or QR code to project **(tinyurl)** **(Its own slide)**
<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
