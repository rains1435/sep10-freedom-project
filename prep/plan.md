**ASK MR. MUELLER IF I NEED TO UPLOAD THE PICTURES ONTO PLANNING OR JUST HAVE THE FILES IN THE wireframes folder I've created**

## Bootstrap
#### Components and Layouts
* Navbar
* Scrollspy
* Dropdowns
* Buttons
* Grid System
* Containers
#### Others
* Typography
* Figures
* Flex
* Colors
* Sizing
* Spacing

## Freedom Project Tool
#### A-Frame and Expectations
* Create an `html` file in main repo for A-Frame scene
* Since it's an display of the DroidNosMoney model, keep the background simple; **TO PUT EMPHASIS ON THE MODEL AS ADDING A TEXTURED BACKGROUND MAY BE DISTRACTING**

## Colors
* `#165226`
* `#ffffff`
* `#c9c9c9`
* `#041704`
* `#000000`

## Fonts
* [Varela Round](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Varela+Round)
* [Special Gothic Expanded One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Special+Gothic+Expanded+One)

## Timeline

#### MVP

* 4/25 --> Create Navbar with links, logo + name, and dropdown that reveals more links. Create sections with certain ids so linking is possible for nav links. Add buttons for navigating pages 1 and 2. Create footers for copyright; keep it simple, for now. **(FOR BOTH PAGES)**

* 4/28 --> Design each section except for home and contact **(USING LAYOUTS)**; ignore minor issues. If there's time, add in all the FP content.

* 4/29 --> Design the home; ignore minor issues.Add color to each section (white and gray pattern). For home section, use color #1, and for footers, use color #4 **(Colors)**. Navbar should use color #5; **keep it simple, for now**. Make Navbar fixed.

* 5/2 -->  Design the contact section; **keep it simple, for now**.

* 5/3 --> Design the A-Frame Scene; **keep it simple, for now**.

---

#### Beyond MVP

* Add scrollspy component on Navbar.
* Improve spacing, part alignments **(flex)**, and add fonts. For example, the Navbar needs spacing between logo + name and the links **(shown in the wireframe for desktop)**
* Expand the A-Frame display; add something extra that would make the final presentation much more better for the audience. **Implement some JavaScript?**

| Abdelrahman | I really like how you added a survey there. Website wise, I like the seperation of parts by color, and I like your images for the future part. | I have two idea that you might want to implement; making the navbar have buttons, making the 'next page' button more obvious. You could knock two birds with one stone and make the pages on the navbar. 
| Derek | I like the 3d design of DroidNosMoney, it looks very similar | I recommend that you make round edges on the 3d model and try to embed the 3d model instead of it being a link. |
| Darren  | Your website looks neat and organized with cool ideas such as DroidNosMoney.  | On larger screens some of yourtext overlaps with the images it is  next  to. To fix this try and add some padding.
| Farzona  | What I really liked from your project was that you included a survey to get people's feedback or any questions that people could've had.  | One thing tyou shoudl probably consider is adding more color to your project becasue it could make it look better and stand out more. Also you should consider spacing out the icons/images from the test becasue some are overlapping and it's making it hard to read it.
